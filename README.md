A basic C++ program to show that I know the basics of the language (to some extend).
If you want to run this script for whatever reason, just use your favorite c++ compiler for it.
IF you do compile this, use a compiler which allows the usage of std::, as the lack of "using namespace std;" makes this code incompatible with compilers that are old enough.
